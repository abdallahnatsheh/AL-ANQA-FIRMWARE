## What is T-Rex?

T-Rex turns the LilyGo T-Deck into a pocket pentesting terminal. No menus, no GUI — just a blinking cursor, a physical keyboard, and a full suite of offensive security tools running on an ESP32-S3.

## Features

**📡 WiFi Attacks** — [full guide](docs/wifi-attacks.md)
- Scan, connect, monitor mode (Nets + Clients views), targeted deauth, raw PCAP capture (Wireshark-compatible), passive probe logger (MAC+SSID harvest → CSV)
- Evil Twin AP with adaptive deauth + captive portal
- Hidden SSID reveal, WPA2 handshake capture + on-device crack, PMKID capture + crack (no client needed)
- MAC spoofer, WPS flag detection
- **Beacon flood** (`bf`) — inject hundreds of fake beacon frames/sec; 5 modes: built-in list, rickroll, sequential, SD file, or clone a real network from scan; ~90-100 frames/sec, random MAC per beacon, automatic channel hopping — [full guide](docs/beacon-flood.md)
- **WiFi IDS** (`wguard`) — passive intrusion detection: deauth flood, evil twin, handshake harvest, PMKID grab, auth flood, probe storm, beacon flood, BSSID cloning, Karma attack; background mode with shield icon + popup alerts; session CSV logs with session-relative timestamps

**📻 ESP-NOW Radio** — [full guide](docs/espnow.md)
- **Off-grid chat** (`ec`) — encrypted peer-to-peer messaging over ESP-NOW; no router, no WiFi association, 200 m+ LOS range; any ESP32/ESP8266 device can join the public channel; private mode uses AES-128 (CCMP) with PIN-derived LMK; 3-attempt PIN validation via encrypted round-trip — wrong PIN silently dropped by hardware; contacts saved to SD (persistent) or RAM (session-only, cleared on reboot); background mode (`ec bg`) with popup bar + notification sounds; timestamps, scroll slider, unread badge, private header shows contact name — [full guide](docs/espnow.md)
- **ESP-NOW sniffer** (`es`) — passive action-frame capture; CSV + PCAP output; channel hop or lock; filter, detail view
- **ESP-NOW diagnostic** (`est`) — broadcast ping every 2 s, RX log, channel select

**🔑 WiFi Credentials** — [full guide](docs/wifi-credentials.md)
- Saved credential manager (`wifipass`) — view all saved passwords
- Auto-save on connect, NVS + SD dual storage
- Linux `wpa_supplicant.conf` bidirectional sync — share networks between T-Deck and Linux

- **BLE GATT enumeration** (`bi`) — connect to any BLE device and read its full service/characteristic tree; 0x2901 user descriptions, 0x2904 type auto-decode (uint8/16/32, int8/16, UTF-8); interactive write (trackpad cursor, write-without-response fallback), fuzz (seq/rand/boundary), notify/indicate sniff with 30 s live stream + write-while-connected, pairing/bonding; `bi all` sweeps every scanned device; full UUID + full hex saved to SD — [full guide](docs/bleinfo.md)
  - **Auth leak detector** (`[b]` audit) — inline risk scoring flags AES-sized binary blobs, hex-encoded secrets, and PIN-shaped values; `[b]` key shows filtered triage view
  - **Write-cap** (`[r]wcap`) — replay any captured notification back to a writable char; sniff auto-saves `.ble` packet archives to SD; load captures from previous sessions
  - **Protocol reverse engineering** — sniff baseline → trigger action on device → identify new packet → replay or write back; works on proprietary protocols with no documentation
- **Tracking detector** (`tm`) — passive BLE + WiFi probe surveillance; 60s baseline learning period; 3-gate pipeline (signature → behaviour score → GPS/time confirmation); Kalman-filtered RSSI; known tracker signatures (AirTag, Tile, SmartTag, Chipolo, Pebblebee); GPS movement gate on T-Deck Plus — [full guide](docs/trackme.md)

- **BLE Keyboard + Mouse** (`bk`) — T-Deck as a wireless BLE HID keyboard + mouse; same features as USB keyboard (`uk`) but over Bluetooth; MITM-protected bonding (passkey shown on screen, typed on host); tap = left click, hold = right click, hold 1.5s = exit; auto-reconnects on drop

**🤖 Claude Desktop Buddy** — [full guide](docs/buddy.md)
- **BLE remote** (`bd`) — approve/deny Claude Desktop permission prompts from the T-Deck keyboard; MITM-protected bonding (passkey shown on screen)
- Full-screen terminal popup for long commands — full text wrapped across multiple lines, no truncation
- Live session stats: tokens, level, mood, energy — all persisted to NVS
- 19 ASCII pet species with 7-state animation at 5 fps

**💾 SD Card**
- Browse, read, delete files; all attack logs saved automatically

**🔌 USB Gadget** — [full guide](docs/usb.md)
- **Mass Storage** (`um`) — expose SD card as a USB drive; read and write files from any PC with no drivers
- **USB Keyboard + Mouse** (`uk`) — T-Deck becomes a full USB input device; physical keyboard types into host, trackball moves the mouse cursor with hardware acceleration; tap = left click, hold = right click, hold 1.5s = exit
- **BadUSB / DuckyScript** (`ux`) — execute keystroke injection payloads; Flipper Zero DuckyScript v1 compatible; built-in T-Rex demo; scripts in `/badusb/` on SD

**🖥️ System** — [full guide](docs/system.md)
- Man pages on-device (`man <cmd>`), paginated help, power save, Matrix animation

## Navigation

All scan tables share the same keys:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `l` / `a` | Next / previous page |
| `u` | Re-run scan |
| `q` | Quit |

**Trackball (command line):**

| Direction | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Left / Right | Move cursor within the current command |
| Up / Down | Scroll through command history (16 entries) |
| Click | Execute command |
| Double-click | Toggle screen off / on |
| Hold 3 seconds | Lock screen (works from any screen) |

**Backspace auto-repeat:** Hold Backspace for **1.5 seconds** → auto-deletes at ~16 chars/sec. Press any char key to stop — the timer resets immediately so the next hold starts fresh. Pressing Backspace a second time while repeat is armed cancels it (tap safety).

**Autocomplete:** Press `'` (Sym+K) at any point in a command.
- At the start → completes command names and short names (`sc` + `'` → `scanwifi`; `ps` + `'` → `portscan`)
- After a command with file args → completes file/dir paths from the current working directory
- After a command with subcommands → shows valid args in yellow (`psv ` + `'` → `on off status save reset set`)
- Two-level context: `psv set ` + `'` → shows settable options; `mc target ` + `'` → `wifi bt both`
- Smart filtering: `cd` suggests dirs only, `rm`/`ux` suggest files only, `ls`/`cat` suggest both
- Fills common prefix automatically (Linux-style); single match adds a trailing space

- [x] Notification manager — I2S WAV playback from SD, per-level volume, screen wake callback; wired into Buddy, TrackMe, wguard
- [x] Lock screen — idle-timeout auto-lock (keyboard + trackpad both reset timer) + hold-trackpad-3s trigger; no-PIN (Space ×3) or SHA-256-hashed PIN (salt via esp_random, mbedTLS); live locked-duration HH:MM:SS; yellow warning when no SD card; recovery = remove SD + reboot; status bar stays live (clock/WiFi/battery update every 1 s while locked)
- [x] Lock screen display blocking — all interactive apps (`buddy`, `wguard`, `trackme`, `beaconflood`, `cat`, `ls`, etc.) correctly freeze on lock and fully restore on unlock
- [x] Backspace hold-repeat redesigned — cold/hot state via `_lastBsReturnMs`; char cancel resets timer to cold so next hold is immediately available; 1500ms hold delay; second tap while armed cancels (prevents accidental auto-delete on rapid taps); same fix in CLI, USB keyboard, and BLE keyboard
- [x] Full docs overhaul — 44 pages, every command documented; Getting Started, Keyboard Reference, Workflows, Troubleshooting, T-Deck vs T-Deck Plus guides; wguard + trackme algorithm docs with academic references; clean nav hierarchy (Just the Docs parent/child/grandchild)
- [ ] LoRa packet logger
- [ ] MAC proximity watchlist
